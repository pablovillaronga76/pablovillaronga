Pablo Villaronga

I am a IT Pro and scripting fanatic, going back to batch files in the early days of DOS. Today, I create content, code, and courses intended to teach PowerShell or to make an IT Pro's job a little easier. You can often find me speaking to user groups and at IT conferences . You can learn about me and links to all of my online activities, including a newsletter at https://pablovillaronga.github.io.

Here is a sample of my latest work:

Introducing PSReminderLite
PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking
The PowerShell Practice
GitHub Scripting Challenge Solution

Social Connections

ðŸ¦‹ You'll find me most active on Github . I am also on LinkedIn. I still have an account on X, but it is not update so regularly .

You might be interested in subscribing to my newsletter, which dives deeper into PowerShell and the culture around it. You can subscribe for free and receive limited content.

ðŸ’¡ Current Work

scripting guy The list below includes some of my current GitHub projects that I think will be of interest to most IT professionals. I write these modules not only to solve common problems or add value to your daily work routine but also to serve as teaching opportunities. As you might expect, much of my work is PowerShell-related, and most modules can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery. You can find all of my repositories by clicking the Repositories link above or here.

You might also find useful bits of information in my GitHub gists.

ðŸ“– Books and Courses from Jeff Hicks  ðŸŽ“

In addition to the well-known Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches book, you can find my other work on LeanPub.	
PowerShell PracticePrimer 	The PowerShell Practice Primer isn't a book to teach your PowerShell, but rather to re-enforce what you already know through 100+ console-based exercises. No scripting is required. Updated with PowerShell 7.x content.
PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking 	If you have read Learn PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches, then you are ready for the next step. Don Jones and I wrote this book intending it to be the definitive guide on everything you need to know to be a better PowerShell scripter and toolmaker.
pluralsight 	I have been creating video training courses for over ten years. I have a large course catalog at Pluralsight, with an emphasis on PowerShell-related content. If you are just getting started with PowerShell 7, I got you covered there as well.
PS Recommendations

ms powershell There is a wealth of code on GitHub. These are a few recommendations for PowerShell-related repositories. Many of these people have published modules in the PowerShell Gallery.
